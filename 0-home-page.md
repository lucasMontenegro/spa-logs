# How To Make A Single Page Web Application

That's what I'm trying to learn. Here I'll be posting my progress. Wish me luck. :)

### You can read this as a learning guide for the Web Stack

If that's what you're doing, keep this in mind:

1. I'm just a beginner. Take everything I write with a grain of salt.
2. Read the cited external sources. This is basically a summary of the tutorials I find on the Web.
3. Have some common sense and google everything else.
4. Put it to practice, don't just read.

### Have some suggestions?
